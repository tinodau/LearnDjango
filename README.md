# LearnDjango

This is my first Django project, i learn django from this awesome website <a href="djangobook.com" target="blank">djangobook.com</a>
Django is so cool and so light framework and again, python is programming language that give you beautiful and clean code. 

This is what i love from python. 
Django adopt MVT programming paradigm (Model View Template), it's like MVC (Model View Controller) but a bit differet, because in MVT, "View" is like "Controller" in MVC, and "Template" in MVT is like "View" in MVC.
Well, that's what i learn, at least from this first project :D  *CMIIW

Hopefully you'll like it (^_^)b
